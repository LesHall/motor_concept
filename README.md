# motor_concept

This is an idea from 2+ years ago (March 2015) that I thought might be of use somehow.  

I don't really know if there is any practical application for the design or even if it will work.  I do know that I built it and did not test it properly.  

Confessions made, the plan is to play around with it a bit and maybe see if it (probably) already exists.  At the very least in the event that it does work then probably it has some limted novelty or utiity as a print-in-place design.
